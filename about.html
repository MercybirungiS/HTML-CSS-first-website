Mercy Birungi is a Ugandan staying in Nairobi Kenya. 
She is currently a student at AkiraChix pursuing a tech course. 
The reason as to why she is pursuing the tech course is because she is passionate about STEM-related subjects and dreams to be a full stack developer sometime in the near future. 
She loves creating things and with the tech skills she is acquiring, she hopes to create change in various communities. 
God is Mercy’s number one fan. She believes that with only Him, all things are possible. 
Throughout her life, she has faced various challenges and  God has  always come through for her in one way or the other so she does not take that for granted.

            Mercy believes that everyone has something to give back. 
She believes that if everyone had the mentality of working for a cause and not just an applaud,
 the world would be a  much better place. Doing good for others provides a natural sense of accomplishment.
  The better you feel about yourself, the more likely you are to have a positive view of your life and future goals. 
  One of Mercy’s goals is to be the change she wants to see and she will only accomplish this by taking responsibility. 
  In summary,Mercy is passionate about giving back because she has known what it means to lack.

               <h2 class="bio">Natural Hair</h2>       
          <img src="/Images/makeup yellow necklace.jpg" class="naturalhair">
            <p class="words">
            Mercy refers to herself as a natural hair enthusiast or rather a ‘Naturalista’.
            She believes that when one wears their natural hair with pride, it inspires others. 
            We're not conditioned to love our curls; it just doesn't work like that 
            especially when we live in a society that just recently widened its stereotypical scope of beauty.
             A scope that once shamed natural hair, in many unjustified cases labelling it "unkept" and "unacceptable." 
             Thankfully, this does not take away the true beauty that is curly hair in all of its kinky, textured, coiled glory. Instead, it builds within us even more resilience, confidence, and strength that comes with wearing our natural curls with an unshakable pride.

            <h2 class="bio">Making crafts</h2>       
            <img src="/Images/punchingNeedles.jpg" class="images">
            <p class="words">
                Art is interesting because there can be so many different perspectives in a piece of art. We all see art differently. 
                It's interesting to hear what somebody sees in a piece of art compared to somebody else.Crafts are art and Mercy believes that  it is one of the best ways one can express themselves .
                Designing shaggy mats is what she does when she is free. 
            She hopes to venture into interior designs using punching needles as displayed in the picture above . 
         She is inspired by her big sister who she helps out sometimes when making her jewelery crafts .

            <h2 class="bio">Travelling</h2>       
            <img src="/Images/sunkissed.jpg" class="images">
            <p class="words">
                Her dream is to travel the whole world mainly because she is a curious person who loves learning about different cultures and the way they do their things most especially when it comes to the different recipes used when cooking. 
She believes that travelling is one of the best ways to enhance personal growth. 
It enables you to do things different from your daily routine activities. 
When you travel, you step out from your comfort zone to a different environment 
which makes you become more responsible and gives a sense of independence.

            <h2 class="bio">Friendship</h2>       
            <img src="/Images/leah and me.jpg" class="images">
            <p class="words">
                Mercy is the kind of person that loves people but also believes that it is better to have quality 
                over quantity. She has come to learn that having a few friends who really appreciate you and have 
                similar goals is the best choice one can make. In addition, she believes that good friends are loyal 
                and accept you for who you are during the good and bad times. Good friends are also honest — honest 
                enough to tell you when you're not being a good friend yourself.  To sum it all, 
                she believes that the three main things that a good friendship should have respect, 
                honesty and trust.

        <h2 class="bio">Quote</h2>       
        <img src="/Images/quoteeee.jpg" class="quotes">
        <p class="words">
            One of Mercy’s favourite quotes is actually a Bible verse, Jeremiah 29:11.
             Whenever facing difficult situations,  
             Jeremiah 29:11 reminds her that yes, 
             it is not a promise that God will immediately rescue her from hardship or suffering,
              but rather a promise that God has a plan for her life and regardless of her current situation, He can work through it to prosper her and give her hope for the future.
