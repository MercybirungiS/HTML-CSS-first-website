            <p>In the book, we clearly see that Abel is a violent man. 
            The manner in which Abel relates with the family is in contrast to how Robert(Trevor Noah’s father) relates with them. Robert's relationship is “illegal” but seems happier. 
            We see that Robert spares some time for his son despite all the rules.  </p> <br>
           <p> Abel is shown to be an alcoholic.Alcoholics may react to alcohol in different ways. They may become verbally insulting, emotionally abusive, may resort to crying and hosting pity-parties, or may be frequently unfaithful when under the influence.

            Being the sober spouse of an alcoholic partner is an exhausting journey that can cause great emotional distress.
            Research shows that alcoholics are selfish when under the influence. They are only out for their own enjoyment and this  oftenly results  into infidelity and other blatant acts of disrespect towards the marriage and because Patricia is the sober spouse, she experiences an exhausting journey that causes great emotional distress. On the other hand, Abel is also shown not to love Trevor. I believe all young children love gifts and that is why Robert, his father buys him presents a thing Abel does not do at any one point. 
               This desfinitely makes Trevor  resent Abel because it seems like he has come to disorganise their peaceful life. 
                </p> <br>
 <p> In addition to that, Abel’s character also gets me to believe that he is a narcissist.
 Narcissists see themselves as superior to others
  so they may become rude or abusive when they don't receive the treatment they think they deserve. 
  While they hold themselves superior, they may speak or act rudely toward those that they deem are inferior. 
    </p> <br>
   <p> I admire the fact that Patricia Noah knows her worth and is a strong willed woman despite the fact that she got married to Abel .I believe she just did it because she wanted a sense of belonging . </p> <br>

  <p> In conclusion , Society can influence the kind of person you become 
      but we all have the freedom to chose between what is right and wrong. 
      Abel choose to be influenced by his society negatively and that is why he was so abusive. 
      My simple advice to you my reader is that the moment you notice the red flags in your relationship, RUN!!!.
       And do not look back!</p>

            <p>Trevor Noah is a comedian but his autobiography provides 
            the reader with humor that not only makes the reader laugh but also appreciate the importance of humor. 
            I greatly believe that humor is a great weapon and tool that brings therapeutic healing to humans.
             Trevor Noah uses humor to show that despite the various differences we may have , there are better ways of appreciating humanity. The type of humor Trevor uses is the self strengthening type of humor. This type of humor lowers the stress level,
              helps us to look at stressful situations from a different perspective, and strengthens social interaction.
             Humour is therefore a tool for subversive change in the various aspects of life.</p>  <br>  
            <p >He  uses humor to describe his birth. 
            He states that when his mothers delivery was taking place, the doctors ‘cut open her belly, reached in and pulled out a half-white -black -child’ who is essentially seen to have violated the laws and regulations thereby being born a crime.
             This clearly shows that the doctors were not concerned about his humanity.
              So we see that Trevor uses humor to make fun out of his own birth painting himself as a child who is unwanted and not tolerated by the political establishment.</p> <br> 
               <p> In addition ,Trevor Noah also shares this sense of humor with his mother, they argue through jokes most
                    Sunday mornings about whether Jesus really wants them to go to church or not. </p>
             <p>Further, the story provides a wonderful glimpse of Noah’s mother, an English teacher and secretary who faced down all manner of oppression and violence beyond just racist minibus drivers to give her children 
              a better chance than she had  and I greatly believe that without humor, they would have been depressed in one way or the other because laughing is medicine to the soul. </p> <br>
              
            <p> Implicitly, Trevor Noah asserts that speaking another person's language bribes the person to see him as part of them. 
              This is the reason the black students loved his company. He is multilingual and thus able to converse in  English and African languages which enables him to make friends in the black society. </p> <br>
